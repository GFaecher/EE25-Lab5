# EE25-Lab5

This contains all of the data relevant to the 5 stage pipelined processor. 

How to run: Make, and then use gtkwave to run either the instructions from p1 or p2.
make
gtkwave p1_wave.ghw 
gtkwave p2_wave.ghw

Yet to be implemented:
Control hazards are not properly handled
Forwarding for load and store instructions is not properly implemented
